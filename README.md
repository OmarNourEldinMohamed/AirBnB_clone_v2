# The AirBnB Clone Project V2

## Project Description
This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where we worked on the backend of the project whiles interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.

Data (python objects) generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed with the help of the json module in python

## CONCEPTS LEARNT
-    How to create a Python package
-    How to create a command interpreter in Python using the `cmd` module
-    What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
-    How to serialize and deserialize a Class
-    How to write and read a JSON file
-    How to manage `datetime`
-    What is an `UUID`
-    What is `*args` and how to use it
-    What is `**kwargs` and how to use it
-    How to handle named arguments in a function

## SYNOPSIS

#### Starting the Commandline Interpreter
The Commandline Interpreter can be started by executing the command `./console.py`. The `console` can `create`, `destroy`, and `update` objects. Type `help` within the console to get a list of command options and its function.

**Example:**
```bash
root@ubuntu:~$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  create  help  quit

Undocumented commands:
======================
all  destroy  show  update

(hbnb) help quit
Quit command to exit the program
(hbnb) quit
root@ubuntu:~$
```
